 abstract = {The effects on the distribution of least-squares residuals of a series of model mis-specifications are considered. It is shown that for a variety of specification errors the distributions of the least-squares residuals are normal, but with non-zero means. An alternative predictor of the disturbance vector is used in developing four procedures for testing for the presence of specification error. The specification errors considered are omitted variables, incorrect functional form, simultaneous equation problems and heteroskedasticity.},
