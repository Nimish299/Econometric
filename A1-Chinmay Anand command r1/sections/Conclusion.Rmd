# Conclusion

In light of the aforementioned empirical inquiry, our endeavor was to explore the relation between distinct variables such as age, BMI, family history, insulin levels and the probability of receiving a favorable diagnosis for diabetes mellitus amongst Indian individuals.

Drawing on the tenets of (robust) regression analysis performed on cross-sectional data, we demonstrated that blood glucose levels, age, family history and high number of pregnancies exhibited statistically significant effects on the likelihood of a positive diagnosis. These results are aligned with extant literature on the subject that also postulated analogous relationships between the said variables and the eventual diagnosis.

That being said, we must underscore several limitations that warrant attention. First and foremost, we utilized a rudimentary cross-sectional dataset that precludes us from accounting for several non-quantitative variables such as sedentary behavior, psychological and physiological stress levels, among others, that could significantly impact blood glucose levels and thereby affect the final diagnosis. Second, we employed a linear probability model for the analysis, which may not be the most appropriate choice for binary dependent variables.
