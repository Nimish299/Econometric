This paper investigates the relationship between various independent variables and diabetes diagnosis, using a cross-sectional dataset of various individuals. The research question is whether certain independent variables, such as age, BMI, and family history, are predictive of diabetes diagnosis. The regression was performed using data released by NIDDK. 
The regression analysis revealed that glucose levels, age, pregnancy count, BMI and family history were all significant predictors of diabetes diagnosis, with older age and higher weight increasing the likelihood of diagnosis, and family history acting as a risk factor. Other independent variables, such as Insulin levels, Skin Thickness and Blood Pressure, were found to have no significant effect on diagnosis.
These findings have important implications for diabetes prevention and management, as they suggest that targeting certain risk factors, such as weight and family history, may be effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes. However, the study is limited by its cross-sectional design.
